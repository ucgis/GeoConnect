## Finding Quality GIS Data

Once you've identified potential data sources, consider these factors when evaluating datasets:

**Data Quality Checks:**
- What is the spatial resolution and accuracy?
- When was the data last updated?
- What is the coordinate reference system?
- Is there metadata documentation?

**Common Data Repositories:**
- **University Libraries**: Many UC libraries maintain GIS data collections
- **Government Sources**: USGS, Census Bureau, NOAA, state and local agencies
- **International Sources**: UN data portals, OpenStreetMap, Natural Earth

**Tips for Success:**
- Start with broader searches and narrow down based on your specific needs
- Pay attention to licensing and usage restrictions
- Document your data sources for reproducibility
- Don't hesitate to reach out to a GIS librarian for guidance on finding specialized datasets
