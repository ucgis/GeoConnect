# About the UC GIS Consultation Tool

## Project Status: Proof of Concept

This is an **experimental proof of concept** 

## What is This Tool?

The UC GIS Consultation Tool is an interactive decision tree that mirrors the consultation process UC GIS librarians use when working with researchers. Instead of navigating a traditional website structure, users follow a branching path of questions and resources tailored to their specific needs.
