# UC GIS Consultation Tool - Proof of Concept

An interactive decision tree that mirrors the consultation process used by UC GIS Librarians to guide researchers through geospatial research needs.

## 🎯 Project Status

**This is an experimental proof of concept (POC).** The tool demonstrates a branching scenario approach to online GIS consultations but is not yet production-ready.

## 📋 Overview

UC GIS Librarians conduct consultations that follow predictable pathways and decision points. This tool transforms that consultation expertise into an interactive, self-guided experience where users navigate through questions and resources based on their specific needs.

## ✨ Features

- **Branching Decision Trees**: Users navigate through questions based on their responses
- **Resource Pages**: Actionable how-to guides with clear steps
- **Graph-Based Architecture**: Any question or resource can link to any other, supporting non-linear consultation flows
- **Visual Distinction**: Clear differentiation between decision points (questions) and actionable content (resources)
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Static Site Generator**: Jekyll 3.10
- **Theme**: Just the Docs 0.8
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons
- **Styling**: Custom SCSS with UC brand colors

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Collections

The tool uses two Jekyll collections:

- **`_questions/`**: Decision points that branch to other questions or resources
- **`_resources/`**: How-to guides and tutorials with actionable steps

### Content Structure

Each content page uses front matter to define relationships:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
sub-title: "Optional subtitle"
next-steps:
  - label: "Button text"
    type: question  # or 'resource'
    ref: filename-without-extension
---
```

### Navigation Pattern

- **Forward navigation**: Through cards and "next steps"
- **Back navigation**: Browser back button
- **Start over**: Link to return to homepage
- No traditional site map - navigation is context-driven

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.x
- Bundler

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd uc-gis
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bundle install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

4. Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser

## ✏️ Adding Content

### Creating a Question Page

1. Create a new file in `_questions/` (e.g., `your-question.md`)
2. Add front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Question Here?"
sub-title: "Brief context"
next-steps:
  - label: "Option 1"
    type: question
    ref: next-question-filename
  - label: "Option 2"
    type: resource
    ref: resource-filename
---

Optional description content here.
```

### Creating a Resource Page

1. Create a new file in `_resources/` (e.g., `your-guide.md`)
2. Add front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "How to Do Something"
sub-title: "Brief description"
jobs_to_be_done:
  - "Goal 1"
  - "Goal 2"
steps:
  - "Step 1 instructions"
  - "Step 2 instructions"
next-steps:
  - label: "Next action"
    type: question
    ref: related-question
---

Additional detailed content in markdown format.
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors

UC brand colors are defined in `_sass/color_schemes/uc.scss`:
- **UC Blue**: `#2774AE`
- **UC Gold**: `#FFB511`

### Styling

Custom styles are in `assets/css/custom.scss`. The file is organized by component for easy navigation.
